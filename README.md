# Titanic Survival Analysis

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Analysis project by Mr. Eklakh! 🚢

This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset using Python and various data science tools to predict passenger survival based on historical data.

📁 Project Structure

Titanic_Analysis_Mr_Eklakh.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook containing the full data exploration, visualization, and machine learning pipeline.

📊 Objective

To perform an end-to-end data analysis and build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, ticket class, etc.

🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

Python 3

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

⚙️ Key Steps

Data Loading – Load the Titanic dataset (CSV format)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize survival trends and missing data

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values and convert categorical data

Feature Engineering – Create new relevant features

Model Building – Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Evaluation – Check accuracy and performance metrics

📈 Results

Built models with solid performance

Gained insights into survival factors (gender, class, age, etc.)

📌 How to Run
